# Dependencies
We use a variety of dependencies so as to avoid re-inventing the wheel or creating our own solutions from scratch. This is so that we can worry about our game in its entirety without having to develop every single thing ourselves, thus improving our verall development timeline.



## C/C++
### GLFW
[GLFW](https://github.com/TheCherno/glfw) is an Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan application development. It provides a simple, platform-independent API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, reading input, handling events, etc.

# Dependencies
We use a variety of dependencies so as to avoid re-inventing the wheel or creating our own solutions from scratch. This is so that we can worry about our game in its entirety without having to develop every single thing ourselves, thus improving our verall development timeline.

Do note that we include all dependencies in our [Libraries](../Libraries/) directory, so as to strip out unneeded files and in the case where we need to modify things.

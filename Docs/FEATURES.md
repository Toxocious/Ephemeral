# Features
Ephemeral has been developed from the ground up with love, and thus comes with a wide variety of features.

Some features are what fans of Pok&eacute;mon would come to expect - battles, exploring hand created worlds - as well as brand new features - multiplayer clans and real-time chatting.

Features may come and go, and this document will be updated to reflect a generalized list of features that are implemented or will eventually be implemented.

Some information regarding what we want to develop and what has already been developed can be found below.

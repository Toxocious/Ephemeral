  <h1 align="center">Pok&eacute;mon Ephemeral - Projects</h1>

  **Pok&eacute;mon Ephemeral** intends to be a handcrafted game engine, game server, and more, all of which will come together to create a Pok&eacute;mon MMO.

  Development of this project will take a great amount of time given the desired scope, but we'll get there.
